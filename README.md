# Arizona Starbucks Locations: Geocoding and Mapping


## Description
All Arizona Starbucks locations were geocoded (converted from normal addresses to longitude and latitude) using the Bing API. This data set was then merged spatially with an Arizona zipcode shapefile. The number of Starbucks in each zipcode were counted. The consequent data file was then used to produce a choropleth map using Matplotlib.
Class: GIS 322 


## Data sources 
starbucks_address.csv and AZ_zipcodes.shp. 
starbucks_address_.csv: All Arizona Starbucks street addresses. 
AZ_zipcodes.shp: Shapefile with Arizona zipcode boundaries.
